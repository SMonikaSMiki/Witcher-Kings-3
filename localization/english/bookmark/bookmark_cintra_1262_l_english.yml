 bm_1262_cintra:0 "The First Northern War"
 bm_1262_cintra_desc:0 "For centuries, the Northern Realms remained in a perpetual state of feuding over lands, claims, and notions of honour, not giving attention to the impending threat south of the Amell Mountains; following the deposition of the "Usurper" and the reinstation of the House of Emreis, Nilfgaard under Imperator Emhyr var Emreis has seen new conquests leading up to Nazair and the border of Cintra.\n\n#bold Emhyr's daughter, Cirilla remains under the care of Cintra's warrior queen, Calanthe, and an invasion of the kingdom is inevitable in light of this information. Can Cintra emerge unscathed from this unlit maelstrom or be engulfed into the Imperial fold as a new province of Nilfgaard?#!"

 bookmark_cintra_calanthe_desc:0 "Known as the 'Lioness of Cintra,' Calanthe leads one of the Northern Realms' most prominent domains, but remains in a precarious situation. Cirilla's place in the Cintran court and the subsequent restoration of the House of Emreis to the Nilfgaardian throne can mean only one thing; war is inevitable, and Cintra cannot counter the full might of Emhyr's legions. But with Calanthe's marriage to Jarl Eist Tuirseach of Skellige and the strategic pass through the Marnadal Stairs, it may be enough to defend her country (if she plays her cards right)."

Renowned for his combat experience, Eist may prove to be an important ally in the fight against Nilfgaardian expansion in the north. With his wife and the notorius Skelliger fleet, Eist may lead both realms toward victory and independence."

Having always intended to return to his homeland with his wife and daughter, Emhyr is now determined to reunite with what remains of his family in the north, even if it means marching to the gates of Cintra itself. After years of tension with the Lioness of Cintra, Emhyr will surely make her barrow the next one to be danced upon."
